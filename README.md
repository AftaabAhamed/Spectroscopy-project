# Spectroscopy-project
classifying the functional groups of hydrocarbons using CNNs trained on spectrograph


Tools & technologies used :TensorFlow, numpy, openCV, pandas, selenium, pyautogui, matplotlib

Utilised selenium and pyautogui to collect training data by scraping the SDBS spectra database

Preprocess spectra graph data using openCV

Trained TensorFlow CNN classification model that yielded 85% accuracy on validation datase
